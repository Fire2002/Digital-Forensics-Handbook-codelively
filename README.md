# Digital-Forensics-Handbook-codelively
(PDF) Ultimate Digital Forensics Handbook from codelively.com. This handbook provides a practical end-to-end-walkthrough on DFIR concepts. This walkthrough includes topics aligned with the NIST 4-step flow of collection, examination, analysis, and reporting.

Investigation methodology + chain of custody (what to preserve, why it matters, and what needs documentation).

Evidence acquisition for live/dead systems (FTK Imager/KAPE, dd, write-blocker notes) as well as cloud collection (AWS/Azure/GCP snapshot flows).

Evidence analysis across memory/disk/logs/network/cloud with concrete starting points (Strings, Volatility, Autopsy, Windows event log focus, Wireshark/tcpdump).

Malware analysis and indicators of compromise (IOC) research resources, along with a clean workflow mindset.

Documentation and Reporting: What a Proper Forensic Report Should Include.
